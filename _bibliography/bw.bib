The group investigated on what are the current problems research and practitioners experience in their work with semantic resources for agricultural data and elaborated the list of requirements that are the object of this paper. The main findings include the need to broaden the usability of tools so as to make them useful and available to the variety of profiles usually involved in working with semantics resources; the need to online platform to lift users from the burden of local installation; and the need for services that can be integrated in workflows. We further analyze requirements concerning the tools and services and provide details about the process followed to gather evidence from the community.},
